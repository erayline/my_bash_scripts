when i need a bash script i make it an put it here so that you can use it as well
i only create useful bash scripts

- first.sh -> this is empty lol

- ran_num.sh -> im practicing method of loci a lot so it's easier for me to generate random numbers in terminal

- stopwatch.sh -> i just needed something small and that's measures time when is study
